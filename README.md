According to  United Census Bureau https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/HSD410221, until 2021, there were around 21 million American who have computer but unable to access to the internet at their home.
Boston Consulting Group https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/digital-access-in-united-states-education and Education Week Research https://www.edweek.org/technology/most-students-now-have-home-internet-access-but//-what-about-the-ones-who-dont/2021/04 estimated that 12 million of them were higher education students in US.
This category is extremely large across the entire world.
This vulnerable group of people does not have the opportunity to access internet-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) apps built on Large Language Models like ChatGPT and Google Bard, etc., or local deep learning models, which require high-performance hardware and software, such as Central Processing Units (CPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), large amounts of Random Access Memory (RAM), and computer skills.
These people have been left behind in the internet revolution, we should not leave them far behind again in the AI revolution. 

I propose a graph-based RingChains topology summarizer which surpasses several
recent deep learning models in zero shot learning (including GPT 3.5)
on several summarization datasets.
This system only needs maximum 200MB memory and 158 MB of disk, so it  can run in any computer.
Thus, people with a computer, even if it is 10 years old, can use this app to experience and benefit from AI.
While this is only a summary app, it supports equitable deployment AI and social good.

##### @RingChains Local Desktop AI Summary App (Version 1.0.1 for Windows OS): Local app! This version requires only 86 MB of free disk space and less than 200 MB of memory to run locally. The app can summarize long documents without length restriction. Users only need to download a single .exe file. This app was built for users who do not have a budget for internet access at home or prefer not to upload their documents to the internet.
#### I. Users can download a single .exe file (an end user version just double clicks for use after finishing download ) from my Google Drive link:

I propose an enhanced Large Language Models(LLMs) architectures for summarizing long documents 
which reduce significant input token cost, number of unimportant input tokens,
and number of unnecessary computational operations when utilizing LLMs for summarizing long documents.
These architectures also handle limited input tokens of most standard LLMs but avoiding 
the expensive process of modifying architecture or of additional training. 
Below is an end user app built on the Local Extractor and API LLM architecture.

### @@ An End User RingChains and API LLM Summarization app (Version 1.1.0 Window OS,158 MB) : In this version, the app can summarize long documents  (ex: 800 pages) both  in 'Local mode' (producing reasonable result) or in 'API mode' (generating fantastic result).

#### II. Developers:
1. Download one or all my python versions (offline_APImultiplerequest.py, offline_API_summary_keywords.py) and builder1.py.

2. Install dependency libraries in requirements.txt for offline mode.

3. Install  an extra packet for API mode:
