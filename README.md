## Note: This app is in the process of development. The code in here I just copied some from my private github. All code will be here when the development is finished
As we know, recent year Artificial Intelligent (AI) has changed the world. Natural Language Processing
(NLP) has achieved a new successful after ChatGPT and GPT4 were released. Many big tech released LLMs 
now. Does everyone get benefits from this amazing process? AI will make a significant revolution and 
open a new history for human society. It is a certain process we cannot avoid or delay. However, we want
more people to be benefited, especially the middle class and lower class also gain benefit from this
new opportunity not just the upper classes people. As we know, the internet apps like ChatGPT, Bing AI,
Google Bart etc... which were developed base on latest LLMs. Thus, they can perform well many NLP tasks,
which include summary task. The basic versions of these apps also are free. Recently,
the https://claude.ai/ provides a specific tool for summary with various types of files.  
AI21 lap also produced a specific internet app for a long document as they say it perform better
than GPT3. However, the book “Introduction to Graph Theory” by Robin J. Wilson (180 pages, PDF file) 
was uploaded, then both showed an error message “Uploaded file is too large…” or “network error.
A user needs the internet to use these models. Thus, people who do not have the internet cannot take 
advantage from these powerful AI. Moreover, these top deep learning models currently have limited 
input tokens. Thus, even though people have money to access the internet and pay for service plus, 
currently these apps cannot perform the summary task for a long document which have more tokens than 
these apps’ cap if a user does not divide the long document to several small parts. According to 
https://www.census.gov, until 2021 , 93.1% of US households or 115.4 million households  have computer,
but only 87.0% or 107.8 million households have the internet. Thus, approximate 7.6 million households or around
19.76 million people in US who have computer but unable to access to the internet. This category is 
huger in development country. In order to benefit more people from the AI development, AI developers 
may consider low-income people's benefit. Thus, how to have an application which can support who do not 
have the internet connected in their device still can deploy AI and who have internet can access
the latest fantastic new technology can produce more equality AI deployment. This scheme creates more
chances for low-income people to reach AI and benefit themselves and fortunate people still enjoy 
a new excellent AI. Thus, more people can be benefited from AI. This app just focuses on summary task
for long document but the purpose behind is to support equality AI deployment.
### version 1.0 : Local mode only. This version only perform a summary task and just need a  computer to perform!
