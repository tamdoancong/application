According to  United Census Bureau https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/HSD410221, until 2021, there were around 21 million American who have computer but unable to access to the internet at their home.
Boston Consulting Group https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/digital-access-in-united-states-education and Education Week Research https://www.edweek.org/technology/most-students-now-have-home-internet-access-but//-what-about-the-ones-who-dont/2021/04 estimated that 12 million of them were higher education students in US.
This category is extremely large across the entire world.
This vulnerable group of people does not have the opportunity to access internet-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) apps built on Large Language Models like ChatGPT and Google Bard, etc., or local deep learning models, which require high-performance hardware and software, such as Central Processing Units (CPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), large amounts of Random Access Memory (RAM), and computer skills.
These people have been left behind in the internet revolution, we should not leave them far behind again in the AI revolution. 

I propose a graph-based RingChains topology summarizer which surpasses several
recent deep learning models in zero shot learning (including GPT 3.5)
on several summarization datasets.
This system only needs maximum 200MB memory and 158 MB of disk, so it  can run in any computer.
Thus, people with a computer, even if it is 10 years old, can use this app to experience and benefit from AI.
While this is only a summary app, it supports equitable deployment AI and social good.

### @RingChains Local Desktop AI summary app(Version 1.0.1 for Window OS) : Local app! This version only needs 86 MB free space and less than 200 MB of memory for running locally.The app can summarize long documents without word or token limit (ex: 800 pages) A user just needs download a single .exe file. This app can run anywhere and anytime with a working computer! This app was built for users who do not have budget for the internet at home or do not want push their documents to the cloud or who  have good finance to access fantastic LLMs app but travel to somewhere without internet connection or cloud system in busy period time . In the future this app will be considered to deliver by CDs or USB!
