## Note: This app is in the process of development. The code in here I just copied some from my private github. All code will be here when the development is finished
### The app can execute the summary task with reasonable results even without an internet connection, and perform  well with the internet when a user uploads a document!  
- *The function in which  a user can upload a file (PDF or TXT)then gets the summary.(This is the main function of this app)*  
**scenario**: 
1. A user opens the app, the user interface will look like this picture

2. If a device of a user is connected to the internet, the user can choose that the app will   
connect to the internet or not by clicking on the left button. If  this button shows "Internet On", then 
the app will connect to the internet if it is available. If  this button shows "Internet Off",then 
the app will not connect to the internet. If a device of a user is not connected to the internet, then the app 
will automatically work without the internet mode. The system will also let a user know that the internet is 
really connected to the app or not. Note: limited functions will perform without the internet mode!
3. Click a button " Upload a File", a new window appears
