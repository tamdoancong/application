## Note: This app is in the process of development. The code in here I just copied some from my private github. All code will be here when the development is finished
As we know, recent year Artificial Intelligent (AI) has changed the world. Natural Language Processing
(NLP) has achieved a new successful after ChatGPT and GPT4 were released. Many big tech released LLMs 
now. Does everyone get benefits from this amazing process? AI will make a significant revolution and 
open a new history for human society. It is a certain process we cannot avoid or delay. However, we want
more people to be benefited, especially the middle class and lower class also gain benefit from this
new opportunity not just the upper classes people. As we know, the internet apps like ChatGPT, Bing AI,
Google Bart etc... which were developed base on latest LLMs. Thus, they can perform well many NLP tasks,
which include summary task. The basic versions of these apps also are free. However, the internet is required to use those apps and the input tokens are limited.  
Recently,the https://claude.ai/ provides a specific tool for summary with various types of files. AI21 lap also produced a specific internet app for a long document as they say it performs better
than GPT3. However, the book “Introduction to Graph Theory” by Robin J. Wilson (180 pages, PDF file) 
was uploaded (May 2023), then both showed an error message “Uploaded file is too large…” or “network error.
A user also needs the internet to use these models.   
Thus, people who do not have the internet cannot take advantage from these powerful AI. Moreover, these top deep learning models currently have restricted 
input tokens. Thus, even though people have money to access the internet and pay for service plus, 
currently these apps cannot perform the summary task for a long document which have more tokens than 
these apps’ cap if a user does not divide the long document to several small parts.   
According to United States Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov, until 2021) ,There are around **21 million** people in US who have computer but cannot access to the internet. This category is 
huger in development countries. In order to benefit more people from the AI development's progress, AI's developers 
may consider more about low-income people's benefit.   
Therefore, how to have an application which can support who do not 
have the internet connecting in their device still can deploy AI and who have the internet can access
the latest fantastic technology can produce more equality AI deployment. This scheme creates more
chances for low-income people to reach AI and benefit themselves and fortunate people also still enjoy 
a new excellent AI. Thus, more people can be benefited from AI.   
This desktop app just focuses on the summary task
for long documents but its deeply purpose is to  support the equitable deployment of AI.

### offline AI summary app(Version 1.0.1 for Window OS) : Local mode only! This version only needs 158 MB free space.The app can summarize long documents without word or token limit (ex: 800 pages) A user just needs download a single .exe file. This version also only needs a computer to run the app! This version was built for users who  do not want to connect to the internet for some reason or who have a computer but cannot access the internet at home can also deploy AI. A user who cannot access the internet at home should go to a public library to access the internet to download the app. In the future this app will be considered to deliver by CDs or USB!

Since a single file with 158 MB cannot be pushed to GitHub, Google Drive was used. A user can download directly from my Google Drive link:

### Combined API and offline summary AI app (Version 1.1.0 Window OS,158 MB) : In this version, the app can summarize long documents  (ex: 800 pages) both  in 'Local mode' (producing reasonable result) or in 'API mode' (generating fantastic result). In API mode, the app can perform chat function like ChatGPT.
